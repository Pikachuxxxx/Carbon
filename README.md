# Hello-Direct3D
DirectX 11 renderer for rendering and practicing interesting and experimental techniques

This project serves as a means for me to learning DirectX. This is formed by watching YouTube series and reading books and other arrticleds on the web. I will also add the list of all resources that helped me. This is NOT, by any means, an entire, from-scratch, all-by-myself, engine, as I am still learning and hopefully add some interesting features to it as I learn more about DirectX API.
